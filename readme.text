Radar Signal Processing Simulation - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The goal of this project is to learn and simulate a 1 dimensional radars system signal processing pipeline to model how radars detect objects. 
This will need to include signal generation , noise filtering, and object detection using Fast Fourier Transform.

1. Signal Generation+ Adding Noise

2. Noise Filtering

3. Object Detection Using Fast Fourier Transform

4. Visualization
